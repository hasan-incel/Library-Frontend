## Project Overview

This application allows users to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on **Publisher**, **Category**, **Book**, **Author**, and **Book Borrowing** data. Data is fetched from the backend API, and operations are performed with user-friendly notifications.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the frontend of the application.
- **React Router**: Used for routing between different pages in the Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Axios**: For making API calls to communicate with the backend.
- **Docker**: The application is containerized using Docker for consistent development and production environments.
- **CSS / Material / Bootstrap**: Frontend design was made using a combination of these styling frameworks (choice made by the developer).
- **Netlify**: The application is deployed live on Netlify.

## Features of the Application

- **Pages**:
  - **Home Page** (Welcome Page)
  - **Publisher** Page
  - **Category** Page
  - **Book** Page
  - **Author** Page
  - **Book Borrowing** Page
  
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Reading** data
  - **Adding** new data
  - **Updating** existing data
  - **Deleting** data

### Additional Requirements

- All CRUD operations are done on the same page.
- Users will be notified in case of successful or failed operations (without using `window.alert`).
- A total of **5 sample entries** must be added for each data type.
- No restrictions on layout or design (you can customize as needed).
- Technologies for the design (CSS, Tailwind, Material, Bootstrap) are free to choose.
- The project does not require responsiveness (only desktop design is necessary).
- The backend and database are provided, and all actions (CRUD operations) should interact with the backend.
